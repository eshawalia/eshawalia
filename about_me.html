            <p>My name is Esha Ahluwalia and I’m 26 years young! I was born and raised in Dubai and lived there until I graduated high school from Jumeirah College. After that I moved to Boston where I did my undergraduate degree in Marketing at Northeastern University - go Huskies! At the same time my mother moved to London so that was my new homebase and where I went during university holidays.

            <p>I was really excited to live in London because I hadn’t been to many European countries. However, I couldn’t explore Europe much because of the pandemic - but I was able to visit Italy with my mother, right before COVID-19. We visited ten different cities in Italy in a span of two weeks and it is till date my favorite holiday!</p>

            <p>After I graduated from college, I worked in Boston for a year at a company called John Hancock and then eventually moved to Dehradun, India. Living in India was a culture shock at first because even though I’m Indian I had never lived in India before. Eventually, as I acclimated, I really loved living there because my mother had also retired and moved back and I have a lot of family in Dehradun as well, so being close to my family and my culture felt really nice.

            <p>Whilst living in India I completed an internship at a company called Mom’s Choice and worked on applying for Graduate School. Even though, I had a Marketing background I really wanted to make a career switch to UX/UI Design so I applied for Graduate programs in this field. I worked hard on crafting my applications for several months and luckily it paid off because I was accepted into several amazing colleges: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pratt Institute</li>
                <li>New York University</li>
                <li>Arizona State University</li>
                <li>University of Michigan</li>
                <li>University of Washington</li>
                <li>School of Visual Arts, New York</li>
                <li>University of Maryland</li>
                <li>Northeastern University</li>
                <li>DePaul University</li>
            </ul> 
        </div>
        
        <div class="layout4">
           <p>As you can imagine it was really hard to decide which college to attend, but I finally decided on Pratt Institute’s MS IXD program because of the following reasons: 
           </p>
           <ol>
               <li>They gave me a generous scholarship.</li>
               <li>The curriculum and professors were fantastic.</li>
               <li>The school is in New York so there are many job and networking opportunities.</li>
               <li>Pratt has a strong alumni network.</li>
           </ol> 
           <p>Now that I’ve moved to New York and I’m attending Pratt Institute, I can wholeheartedly say that I made the right decision because I’m enjoying living in New York and I’m loving my Pratt student experience. </p>
